# Companion Chatbot Interface for Healthcare Providers
821 Biostats Final Project made by Jiechen Li & Yulei (Alicia) Xia

## Project Overview
This project develops a software interface that serves as a bridge between a companion chatbot (hardware) and healthcare providers. The interface notifies healthcare providers about potential cognitive issues in patients, indicated by verbal repetition detected by the chatbot.

## Features
- Real-time alerts for verbal repetitions.
- Secure and private data handling.
- Scalable backend architecture using Flask.
- User-friendly frontend dashboard for healthcare providers.

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python, Flask, Docker, Azure (maybe)
- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript
- Database: To be determined

## Data Handling
The backend will process data received from the chatbot. A search for existing dementia patient data APIs will be conducted. If none are available, we will simulate patient chat data.
