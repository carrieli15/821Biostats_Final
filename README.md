# Student Information Management System

## Project Description
The Student Information Management System is a Python-based application designed to help educational institutions manage student data efficiently. This system allows users to perform various operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and displaying student information, as well as computing and displaying statistics on students' grades.

## Motivation
The motivation behind choosing this project was to create a practical tool that could be utilized by educational institutions for better data management. The need for digital solutions in educational administration is growing, and this project aims to provide a user-friendly, efficient way to handle student data.

## Functionalities
- **Data Insertion**: Add new student records with details such as student ID, name, and scores.
- **Data Deletion**: Remove existing student records.
- **Data Updating**: Modify details of existing student records.
- **Data Display**: Show all current student records.
- **Statistics**: Calculate and display statistics such as average, maximum, and minimum scores.
- **Data Persistence**: Load and save student data from/to a file.

## Development Plan
